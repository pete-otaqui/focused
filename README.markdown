Focused - a jQuery plugin to track the currently focused element
================================================================

Based on Lars Gersman's work, http://plugins.jquery.com/project/focused, but updated now that jQuery 1.4 has ".live"

Uses a simplifed version of the ":focusable" selector from jQuery UI
